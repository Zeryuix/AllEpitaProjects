# All Epita Projects

I list here all my EPITA projects to avoid cheating.

## ING2/ING3 MTI

In this section, I will talk about the projects done in the MTI major (Multimedia and Information Technology).

## PLIC (Flutter, Figma, MS Project, GitLab)

PLIC is the biggest project I've worked on (10 months project). We worked in agile with 3 weeks sprints.

Objective: to work in teams of 4 to create a web and mobile application to help EPITA students in their first year of engineering studies. The application offers courses and exercises, but its innovation is based on the community aspect: students can carry out exercises/courses together in a room. Students can add exercises and courses using their phone: an OCR then an AI summarizes their course to make an index card. A StackOverflow-style messaging and question/answer system is also integrated. 
Role: mobile front-end development and application design

## PFEE x Rakuten (ReactJS, NextJS, Material-UI) (5 months project)
Objective: in a team of 4, to carry out the back-office of Rakuten's messaging management in order to problems with their C2C messaging system.
Role: front-end development

We used the C language during this period.

Fnmatch is a project during the piscine where you have to reprogram the a simplified version of the fnmatch(3) command and you have approximately 26 hours to do it (bed time excluded ðŸ˜Ž).

Tinyprintf is a very short project (8 hours) where you have to reprogram a simplified version of the printf(3) command (man 3 printf) with variable expansion (%d for example)

## Minimake (C)
1 week project, I had to implement a program that can recognize a Makefile in order to compile a project.

## Malloc (C)
1 week project, I had to implement a program with simplified versions of malloc, calloc and realloc.

## MyFind (C)
1 week project, I had to implement a simplified version of the shell command find(1)
